## AEM Analyser Maven Plugin

A Maven plugin used by developers who develop Java components for AEMaaCS 
(AEM as a Cloud Service) during their local Java 
builds to ensure that their components work correctly in when deployed to 
AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Goals

Provide an easy way for AEMaaCS users to run analysers with their components during local 
builds to ensure these components will also pass the analysers at AEMaaCS deploy time and 
function as expected at runtime.
